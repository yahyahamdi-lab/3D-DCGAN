# 3D-DCGAN (Shape generation and completion)

# Methods
This code implements deep 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based convolutional layers that operate in voxel space and train to generate or complete 3D voxel-based objects. This work is inspired by the study in https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00734, with some modifications to the GAN architecture.
